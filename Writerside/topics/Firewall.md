# Firewall

The firewall is a simple computer with `pfSense` installed on it.

`pfSense` is a `FreeBSD` based software that is often used to power firewalls. This means that there are some hardware requirements involved:
> - the device must be powered by an **AMD64 CPU** (because ARM CPUs are not widely supported) and its network interfaces mustn't use **Realtek chipsets** (Intel chipset are recommended because of compatibility issues).
> - we need at least three network interfaces (**WAN**, **LAN** and **OPT1**).
> 
> `In our case, the hardware doesn't matter because it is installed on a VM.`

## Description

The firewall has several uses in this architecture:
- **Packets filtering**: restrict access outwards and inwards using rules applying on specific ports and protocols.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: network management protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network using a clientâ€“server architecture.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: hierarchical and distributed name service that provides a naming system for computers, services, and other resources on the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks.
- **Router**: acts as a bridge between different networks (here, between the sub-LANs and the WAN).
- **NAT (Network Address Translation)**: method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device (here, rules for HTTP and HTTPS requests for the web server).
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: creates a secure connection on a public network.
- **Monitoring and reports**: provides tools to monitor the traffic on the network and to generate detailed reports.
- **Bandwidth management**: controls and limits the bandwidth.

## Network interfaces

### LAN (Local Area Network) & OPT1

The LAN (and OPT1) interface is connected to our internal private networks. It is responsible for the communication between devices on those private networks.

- **IP Addresses**: LAN 10.0.0.1, OPT1 10.0.0.9
- **Description**: Gives access to internet to all devices connected to that interface and applies security rules to protect the local networks.

### WAN (Wide Area Network)

The WAN interface is connected to internet. It receives a public IP address from the ISP (Internet Service Provider). **On our VM, we configured this interface in `NAT`, so that it receives an IP address from the host, without having problems with the network configurations at YNOV**.

- **IP Address**: Attributed by DHCP (VM's host)
- **Description**: Manages the inward and outward traffic, applying the security rules to protect from outside threats.

### DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)

The DMZ interface is used to host services reachable from internet, isolating it from the local network (LAN) for security purposes.

- **IP Address**: 10.0.1.1
- **Description**: Hosts our webserver which documentation is publicly reachable and applies security rules to limit access to specific services.

## Conclusion

The **pfSense** firewall plays a crucial role in the security of our network infrastructure controlling all traffic between its interfaces (WAN, LAN, OPT1, DMZ) applying security rules that we chose and just presented.
